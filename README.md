My Next.js Project with Supabase
This project is a Next.js application with Supabase as the backend. It demonstrates how to use Supabase for managing data (such as movies, users, etc.) and Next.js for building the frontend.

Features
Next.js for the frontend.
Supabase for the backend (database, authentication, storage).
Video upload functionality.
Display of trending and top-rated movies.
User interaction (like/dislike functionality).
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later): Install Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn: Comes with Node.js by default.
Supabase account: Create an account on Supabase
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn install
3. Set up Supabase
You will need to create a Supabase project and configure the environment variables.

Go to Supabase, create a new project, and set up your database.
Add your Supabase credentials to the .env.local file in the root directory of your project.
Here’s an example of what your .env.local file should look like:

env
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: Found in the Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > API.
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: The public anonymous key found in the same section.
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: The service role key for server-side use.
4. Database Setup
You can use the following SQL schema to set up the necessary tables in your Supabase database.

Go to the SQL Editor in Supabase and run the following SQL commands:

sql
Copy code
-- Movies table
create table upload (
  id serial primary key,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  file_url text not null,
  created_at timestamp default current_timestamp
);

-- Likes table for tracking movie likes
create table likes (
  id serial primary key,
  user_id text not null,
  movie_id integer not null references upload(id),
  created_at timestamp default current_timestamp
);
5. Running the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
or

bash
Copy code
yarn dev
This will start the application in development mode at http://localhost:3000.

6. Build for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
or

bash
Copy code
yarn build
To run the production server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
or

bash
Copy code
yarn start
7. Testing the App
Once the server is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see your application where you can upload videos and view the trending and top-rated movies.

Folder Structure
Here’s a basic overview of the folder structure:

bash
Copy code

├── /pages                # Next.js pages
├── /public               # Static assets (images, videos, etc.)
├── /styles               # Global styles
├── /utils                # Utility functions (e.g., Supabase client setup)

├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md             # This file
Supabase Setup
This project uses Supabase for authentication, database, and file storage. You can configure your Supabase client like so:

js
Copy code
// supabaseClient.js

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);

export default supabase;
